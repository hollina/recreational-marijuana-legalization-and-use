abstract = {Abstract We study the effect of recent legalization of recreational marijuana use laws (RMLs) in the United States on new applications and allowances for Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income over the period 2001–2019. We combine administrative caseload data from the Social Security Administration with state policy changes using two-way fixed-effects methods. We find that RML adoption increases applications for both benefits. However, there is no change in allowances post-RML. We provide suggestive evidence that the observed changes in applications post-RML are driven by increases in marijuana misuse and selective migration, and decreases in unemployment.},

abstract = {Marijuana is partially prohibited: though banned federally, it is available to 1 in 4 U.S. adults under state statutes. We measure the size of the interstate trade generated by state-level differences in legal status with a natural experiment: Oregon allowed stores to sell marijuana for recreational use on October 1, 2015, next to Washington where stores had been selling recreational marijuana since July 2014. Using administrative data covering the universe of Washington's sales and a differences-in-discontinuities approach, we find retailers along the Oregon border experienced a 36\% decline in sales immediately after Oregon's market opened. We investigate the home location of recent online reviewers of marijuana retailers and find similar cross-border patterns. By the end of Washington's 2018 fiscal year, our results imply that Washington had earned between $44 million and $75 million in tax revenue from cross-border shoppers. These cross-border incentives may create a “race to legalize.”}

We decompose the well documented decline in white public enrollment following desegregation into migration to suburban districts and increased private school enrollment and find that migration was the more prevalent response. Desegregation caused black public enrollment to increase significantly outside of the South, mostly by slowing decentralization of black households to the suburbs, and large black private school enrollment declines in southern districts. Central district school desegregation generated only a small portion of overall urban population decentralization between 1960 and 1990. (JEL H75, I21, J15, R23)},

abstract = {Objective To describe patterns of diagnostic testing and antibiotic management of uncomplicated pneumonia in general community hospitals and children's hospitals within hospitals and to determine the association between diagnostic testing and length of hospital stay. Study design We conducted a retrospective cohort study of children 1-17 years of age hospitalized with the diagnosis of pneumonia from 2007 to 2010 to hospitals contributing data to Perspective Database Warehouse, assessing patterns of diagnostic testing and antibiotic management. We constructed logistic regression models of log-transformed length of stay (LOS) and grouped treatment models to ascertain whether performance of blood cultures and viral respiratory testing were associated with LOS. Results A total of 17 299 pneumonia cases occurred at 125 hospitals, with considerable variability in pneumonia management. Only 40 (0.2{\%}) received ampicillin/penicillin G alone or in combination with other antibiotics, and 1318 (7.4{\%}) received macrolide monotherapy as initial antibiotic management. Performance of blood culture and testing for respiratory viruses was associated with a statistically significant longer LOS, but these differences did not persist in grouped treatment models. Conclusions We observed greater rates of diagnostic testing in this cohort of structurally diverse hospitals than previously reported at freestanding children's hospitals, with extremely low rates of narrow-spectrum antibiotic use. Tailored antibiotic stewardship initiatives at these hospitals are needed to achieve adherence to national guideline recommendations. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.

However, if legal substances are highly substitutable, tax revenues from marijuana may crowd out pre-existing revenues. We study the change in substance tax revenues caused by legalizing marijuana in Washington state, accounting for potential substitutability and complementarity between marijuana, alcohol, and tobacco. We use a combination of detailed administrative data on retail marijuana and scanner data on alcohol and tobacco sales. By estimating a demand system for legal substances and controlling for prices, we find that substances are substitutes and the legalization of marijuana itself leads to a 12{\%} decrease in alcohol demand and a 20{\%} decrease in tobacco demand. 50{\%} of state marijuana tax revenue is cannibalized by the reduction in alcohol and tobacco taxes. When those industries adjust their prices, only 18{\%} of marijuana tax revenue comes from alcohol and tobacco. Though Washington has the highest marijuana tax rate in the country, a 1{\%} increase in the marijuana tax results in a 1.22{\%} increase in total revenues collected by the state.},

@article{SAMHSA2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND Multiple federally funded surveys collect data on tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use among adolescents. Seemingly similar measures in these surveys may yield different estimates of substance use among adolescents. This study can provide information on possible reasons for any differences in estimates among the surveys, how to interpret trends and patterns in substance use, and how to best analyze these data. METHODS This methodology report describes and compares adolescent substance use data from the 2002 to 2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), a U.S. household survey, and two school-based surveys: the 2002 to 2008 Monitoring the Future (MTF) survey, and the 2003, 2005, and 2007 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS). Where these surveys yield different estimates of substance use, this report examines possible reasons for these differences. The goals of this study are (1) to compare overall estimates, subgroup patterns, and trends over time among the different surveys; (2) to help users understand the reasons for differences in these estimates; (3) to facilitate accurate interpretation of results from these surveys; and (4) to improve the understanding of the true nature and extent of youth substance use in the United States. RESULTS In most instances, NSDUH estimates of substance use for adolescents enrolled in school were lower than corresponding estimates from MTF and YRBS. In addition, YRBS estimates for 10th and 12th graders tended to be higher than MTF estimates. However, the three surveys generally show similar findings in which subgroups of adolescents have relatively higher or lower substance use estimates. Also, NSDUH and MTF, which are conducted annually, generally provide similar findings about changes over time (i.e., trends) in the prevalence cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use among 12th graders. The methodological differences among the surveys include the setting (i.e., household vs. school) and the responding populations. NSDUH estimates generally were consistent with the hypothesis that youths who have used substances tend to underreport their use in household interview settings if their interviews are not private. Because YRBS and MTF estimate substance use for in-school youth they do not include dropouts. In general, YRBS and MTF estimates for youths in school align closely with overall youth estimates, except for those subpopulations and substances that have higher rates of absenteeism and dropouts and higher substance use. CONCLUSIONS Because of the many methodological differences among NSDUH, MTF, and YRBS, this methodology report does not conclude that estimates of substance use among adolescents from any one of these surveys are more accurate than estimates from another. Each survey has definite strengths and limitations. The multiple methodological differences all can contribute to differences in estimates across these surveys.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This study statistically ranked states' performance on adolescent substance use related to cancer risk (past-month cigarette smoking, binge alcohol drinking, and marijuana use). METHODS: Data came from 69,200 adolescent participants (50 states and the District of Columbia) in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) and 450,050 adolescent participants (47 states) in the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS). Adolescents were aged 14 to 17 years. For 2011-2015, we estimated and ranked states' prevalence of adolescent substance use. We calculated the ranks' 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) using a Monte Carlo method with 100,000 simulations. Spearman correlations examined consistency of ranks. RESULTS: Across states, the prevalence of cigarette smoking was 4.5{\%} to 14.3{\%} in NSDUH and 4.7{\%} to 18.5{\%} in YRBSS. Utah had the lowest prevalence (NSDUH: rank = 51 [95{\%} CI, 47-51]; YRBSS: rank = 47 [95{\%} CI, 46-47]), and states' ranks across surveys were correlated (r = 0.66, P {\textless} .001). The prevalence of binge alcohol drinking was 5.9{\%} to 14.3{\%} (NSDUH) and 7.1{\%} to 21.7{\%} (YRBSS). Utah had the lowest prevalence (NSDUH: rank = 50 [95{\%} CI, 40-51]; YRBSS: rank = 47 [95{\%} CI, 47-47]), but ranks across surveys were weakly correlated (r = 0.38, P = .01). The prevalence of marijuana use was 6.3{\%} to 18.7{\%} (NSDUH) and 8.2{\%} to 27.1{\%} (YRBSS). Utah had the lowest prevalence of marijuana use (NSDUH: rank = 50 [95{\%} CI = 33-51]; YRBSS: rank= 46 [95{\%} CI, 46-46]), and ranks across surveys were correlated (r = 0.70, P {\textless} .001). Wide CIs for states ranked in the middle of each distribution obscured statistical differences among them. CONCLUSION: Variability emerged across adolescent substance use behaviors and surveys (perhaps because of administration differences). Most states showed statistically equivalent performance on adolescent substance use. Adolescents in all states would benefit from efforts to reduce substance use, to prevent against lifelong morbidity.},

@article{Anderson2019,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To summarize recent research and select the best papers published in 2015 in the field of computerized clinical decision support for the Decision Support section of the IMIA yearbook. METHOD: A literature review was performed by searching two bibliographic databases for papers related to clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) and computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems. The aim was to identify a list of candidate best papers from the retrieved papers that were then peer-reviewed by external reviewers. A consensus meeting between the two section editors and the IMIA editorial team was finally conducted to conclude in the best paper selection. RESULTS: Among the 974 retrieved papers, the entire review process resulted in the selection of four best papers. One paper reports on a CDSS routinely applied in pediatrics for more than 10 years, relying on adaptations of the Arden Syntax. Another paper assessed the acceptability and feasibility of an important CPOE evaluation tool in hospitals outside the US where it was developed. The third paper is a systematic, qualitative review, concerning usability flaws of medication-related alerting functions, providing an important evidence-based, methodological contribution in the domain of CDSS design and development in general. Lastly, the fourth paper describes a study quantifying the effect of a complex, continuous-care, guideline-based CDSS on the correctness and completeness of clinicians' decisions. CONCLUSIONS: While there are notable examples of routinely used decision support systems, this 2015 review on CDSSs and CPOE systems still shows that, despite methodological contributions, theoretical frameworks, and prototype developments, these technologies are not yet widely spread (at least with their full functionalities) in routine clinical practice. Further research, testing, evaluation, and training are still needed for these tools to be adopted in clinical practice and, ultimately, illustrate the benefits that they promise.},

abstract = {Once-daily, low-dose aspirin is a cornerstone in the prophylaxis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Aspirin 'resistance' still lacks definition, a standardized reference assay, underlying mechanisms, clinical impact or efficacy of alternative antiplatelet drugs. Aspirin response in several studies has been measured by different platelet function tests, not always reflecting aspirin pharmacodynamics, thus generating significantly heterogeneous results. The EMA indicated serum thromboxane B2 as the only valid surrogate assay to study different aspirin formulations. Rather than resistance, recent studies focused on sources of intra- and inter-individual variability in response to aspirin, based on pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic mechanisms. Drug interactions, diabetes, conditions of increased platelet output, obesity and aging can potentially increase the variability of aspirin response. Preliminary studies testing different aspirin regimens showed that twice-daily low doses were more effective than once-daily higher aspirin doses on surrogate end points of platelet inhibition. Large studies are needed to test new disease-tailored, low-dose aspirin regimens. {\textcopyright} 2013 Expert Reviews Ltd.},

abstract = {Almost half of the US states have adopted “medical marijuana” laws (MMLs), and 58{\%} of Americans now favor marijuana legalization. Despite public support, federal law continues to prohibit the use and sale of marijuana due to public health concerns of increased abuse, drugged driving, and youth access. Using evidence from MMLs, this is the first paper to study whether growth in the size of legal marijuana markets affects illegal use and its associated health consequences. By collecting new data on per capita registered medical marijuana patient rates, I investigate how state supply regulations and changes in federal enforcement affect the size of this legal market. I then study how illegal marijuana use and other health outcomes respond to changes in legal availability. I find that growth in the legal medical marijuana market significantly increases recreational use among all age groups. Increased consumption among older adults has positive consequences in the form of an 11{\%} reduction in alcohol- and opioid-poisoning deaths. However, increased consumption among youths leads to negative externalities. Raising the share of adults registered as medical marijuana patients by one percentage point increases the prevalence of recent marijuana use among adolescents and young adults by 5-6{\%} and generates negative externalities in the form of increased traffic fatalities (7{\%}) and alcohol poisoning deaths (4{\%}).},

abstract = {AIMS To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies in order to estimate the effect of US medical marijuana laws (MMLs) on past-month marijuana use prevalence among adolescents. METHODS A total of 2999 papers from 17 literature sources were screened systematically. Eleven studies, developed from four ongoing large national surveys, were meta-analyzed. Estimates of MML effects on any past-month marijuana use prevalence from included studies were obtained from comparisons of pre-post MML changes in MML states to changes in non-MML states over comparable time-periods. These estimates were standardized and entered into a meta-analysis model with fixed-effects for each study. Heterogeneity among the study estimates by national data survey was tested with an omnibus F-test. Estimates of effects on additional marijuana outcomes, of MML provisions (e.g. dispensaries) and among demographic subgroups were abstracted and summarized. Key methodological and modeling characteristics were also described. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. RESULTS None of the 11 studies found significant estimates of pre-post MML changes compared with contemporaneous changes in non-MML states for marijuana use prevalence among adolescents. The meta-analysis yielded a non-significant pooled estimate (standardized mean difference) of -0.003 (95{\%} confidence interval = -0.012, +0.007). Four studies compared MML with non-MML states on pre-MML differences and all found higher rates of past-month marijuana use in MML states pre-MML passage. Additional tests of specific MML provisions, of MML effects on additional marijuana outcomes and among subgroups generally yielded non-significant results, although limited heterogeneity may warrant further study. CONCLUSIONS Synthesis of the current evidence does not support the hypothesis that US medical marijuana laws (MMLs) until 2014 have led to increases in adolescent marijuana use prevalence. Limited heterogeneity exists among estimates of effects of MMLs on other patterns of marijuana use, of effects within particular population subgroups and of effects of specific MML provisions.},

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Opioid analgesic overdose mortality continues to rise in the United States, driven by increases in prescribing for chronic pain. Because chronic pain is a major indication for medical cannabis, laws that establish access to medical cannabis may change overdose mortality related to opioid analgesics in states that have enacted them. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association between the presence of state medical cannabis laws and opioid analgesic overdose mortality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A time-series analysis was conducted of medical cannabis laws and state-level death certificate data in the United States from 1999 to 2010; all 50 states were included. EXPOSURES: Presence of a law establishing a medical cannabis program in the state. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Age-adjusted opioid analgesic overdose death rate per 100 000 population in each state. Regression models were developed including state and year fixed effects, the presence of 3 different policies regarding opioid analgesics, and the state-specific unemployment rate. RESULTS: Three states (California, Oregon, and Washington) had medical cannabis laws effective prior to 1999. Ten states (Alaska, Colorado, Hawaii, Maine, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Rhode Island, and Vermont) enacted medical cannabis laws between 1999 and 2010. States with medical cannabis laws had a 24.8{\%} lower mean annual opioid overdose mortality rate (95{\%} CI, -37.5{\%} to -9.5{\%}; P = .003) compared with states without medical cannabis laws. Examination of the association between medical cannabis laws and opioid analgesic overdose mortality in each year after implementation of the law showed that such laws were associated with a lower rate of overdose mortality that generally strengthened over time: year 1 (-19.9{\%}; 95{\%} CI, -30.6{\%} to -7.7{\%}; P = .002), year 2 (-25.2{\%}; 95{\%} CI, -40.6{\%} to -5.9{\%}; P = .01), year 3 (-23.6{\%}; 95{\%} CI, -41.1{\%} to -1.0{\%}; P = .04), year 4 (-20.2{\%}; 95{\%} CI, -33.6{\%} to -4.0{\%}; P = .02), year 5 (-33.7{\%}; 95{\%} CI, -50.9{\%} to -10.4{\%}; P = .008), and year 6 (-33.3{\%}; 95{\%} CI, -44.7{\%} to -19.6{\%}; P {\textless} .001). In secondary analyses, the findings remained similar. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Medical cannabis laws are associated with significantly lower state-level opioid overdose mortality rates. Further investigation is required to determine how medical cannabis laws may interact with policies aimed at preventing opioid analgesic overdose.},

abstract = {Importance Historical shifts are occurring in marijuana policy. The effect of legalizing marijuana for recreational use on rates of adolescent marijuana use is a topic of considerable debate. Objective To examine the association between the legalization of recreational marijuana use in Washington and Colorado in 2012 and the subsequent perceived harmfulness and use of marijuana by adolescents. Design, Setting, and Participants We used data of 253 902 students in eighth, 10th, and 12th grades from 2010 to 2015 from Monitoring the Future, a national, annual, cross-sectional survey of students in secondary schools in the contiguous United States. Difference-in-difference estimates compared changes in perceived harmfulness of marijuana use and in past-month marijuana use in Washington and Colorado prior to recreational marijuana legalization (2010-2012) with postlegalization (2013-2015) vs the contemporaneous trends in other states that did not legalize recreational marijuana use in this period. Main Outcomes and Measures Perceived harmfulness of marijuana use (great or moderate risk to health from smoking marijuana occasionally) and marijuana use (past 30 days). Results Of the 253 902 participants, 120 590 of 245 065(49.2{\%}) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 15.6 (1.7) years. In Washington, perceived harmfulness declined 14.2{\%} and 16.1{\%} among eighth and 10th graders, respectively, while marijuana use increased 2.0{\%} and 4.1{\%} from 2010-2012 to 2013-2015. In contrast, among states that did not legalize recreational marijuana use, perceived harmfulness decreased by 4.9{\%} and 7.2{\%} among eighth and 10th graders, respectively, and marijuana use decreased by 1.3{\%} and 0.9{\%} over the same period. Difference-in-difference estimates comparing Washington vs states that did not legalize recreational drug use indicated that these differences were significant for perceived harmfulness (eighth graders: {\%} [SD], −9.3 [3.5];P = .01; 10th graders: {\%} [SD], −9.0 [3.8];P = .02) and marijuana use (eighth graders: {\%} [SD], 5.0 [1.9];P = .03; 10th graders: {\%} [SD], 3.2 [1.5];P = .007). No significant differences were found in perceived harmfulness or marijuana use among 12th graders in Washington or for any of the 3 grades in Colorado. Conclusions and Relevance Among eighth and 10th graders in Washington, perceived harmfulness of marijuana use decreased and marijuana use increased following legalization of recreational marijuana use. In contrast, Colorado did not exhibit any differential change in perceived harmfulness or past-month adolescent marijuana use following legalization. A cautious interpretation of the findings suggests investment in evidence-based adolescent substance use prevention programs in any additional states that may legalize recreational marijuana use.},

abstract = {Background: Marijuana is the most frequently used illicit substance in the United States. Little is known of the role that macro-level factors, including community norms and laws related to substance use, play in determining marijuana use, abuse and dependence. We tested the relationship between state-level legalization of medical marijuana and marijuana use, abuse, and dependence. Methods: We used the second wave of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC), a national survey of adults aged 18+ (n = 34,653). Selected analyses were replicated using the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), a yearly survey of ∼68,000 individuals aged 12+. We measured past-year cannabis use and DSM-IV abuse/dependence. Results: In NESARC, residents of states with medical marijuana laws had higher odds of marijuana use (OR: 1.92; 95{\%} CI: 1.49-2.47) and marijuana abuse/dependence (OR: 1.81; 95{\%} CI: 1.22-2.67) than residents of states without such laws. Marijuana abuse/dependence was not more prevalent among marijuana users in these states (OR: 1.03; 95{\%} CI: 0.67-1.60), suggesting that the higher risk for marijuana abuse/dependence in these states was accounted for by higher rates of use. In NSDUH, states that legalized medical marijuana also had higher rates of marijuana use. Conclusions: States that legalized medical marijuana had higher rates of marijuana use. Future research needs to examine whether the association is causal, or is due to an underlying common cause, such as community norms supportive of the legalization of medical marijuana and of marijuana use. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {This study documents how the changing legal status of marijuana has impacted mortality in the United States over the past two decades. We use a difference-in-difference approach to estimate the effect of medical marijuana laws (MML) and recreational marijuana laws (RML) on fatalities from opioid overdoses, and we find that marijuana access induces sharp reductions in opioid mortality rates. Our research corroborates prior findings on MMLs and offers the first causal estimates of RML impacts on opioid mortality to date, the latter of which is particularly important given that RMLs are far more expansive in scope and reach than MMLs. In our preferred econometric specification, we estimate that RMLs reduce annual opioid mortality in the range of 20{\%}–35{\%}, with particularly pronounced effects for synthetic opioids. In further analysis, we demonstrate how RML impacts vary among demographic groups, shedding light on the distributional consequences of these laws. Our findings are especially important and timely given the scale of the opioid crisis in the United States and simultaneously evolving attitudes and regulations on marijuana use.

abstract = {PURPOSE: The state-level legalization of medical marijuana has raised concerns about increased accessibility and appeal of the drug to youth. The objective of this study was to assess the impact of medical marijuana legalization across the United States by comparing trends in adolescent marijuana use between states with and without legalization of medical marijuana. METHODS: The study utilized data from the Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance Survey between 1991 and 2011. States with a medical marijuana law for which at least two cycles of Youth Risk Behavioral Surveillance data were available before and after the implementation of the law were selected for analysis. Each of these states was paired with a state in geographic proximity that had not implemented the law. Chi-squared analysis was used to compare characteristics between states with and without medical marijuana use policies. A difference-in-difference regression was performed to control for time-invariant factors relating to drug use in each state, isolating the policy effect, and then calculated the marginal probabilities of policy change on the binary dependent variable. RESULTS: The estimation sample was 11,703,100 students. Across years and states, past-month marijuana use was common (20.9{\%}, 95{\%} confidence interval 20.3-21.4). There were no statistically significant differences in marijuana use before and after policy change for any state pairing. In the regression analysis, we did not find an overall increased probability of marijuana use related to the policy change (marginal probability .007, 95{\%} confidence interval -.007, .02). CONCLUSIONS: This study did not find increases in adolescent marijuana use related to legalization of medical marijuana.},

This paper derives an expression for this general DD estimator, and shows that it is a weighted average of all possible two-group/ two-period DD estimators in the data. This result provides detailed guidance about how to use regression DD in practice. I define the DD estimand and show how it averages treatment effect heterogeneity and that it is biased when effects change over time. I propose a new balance test derived from a unified definition of common trends. I show how to decompose the difference between two specifications, and I apply it to models that drop untreated units, weight, disaggregate time fixed effects, control for unit-specific time trends, or exploit a third difference.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Society for Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics. A major challenge in assessing the public health impact of legalizing cannabis use in Colorado and Washington State is the absence of any experience with legal cannabis markets. The Netherlands created a de facto legalized cannabis market for recreational use, but policy analysts disagree about how it has affected rates of cannabis use. Some US states have created de facto legal supply of cannabis for medical use. So far this policy does not appear to have increased cannabis use or cannabis- related harm. Given experience with more liberal alcohol policies, the legalization of recreational cannabis use is likely to increase use among current users. It is also likely that legalization will increase the number of new users among young adults but it remains uncertain how many may be recruited, within what time frame, among which groups within the population, and how many of these new users will become regular users.},

abstract = {Aims To examine changes in the evidence on the adverse health effects of cannabis since 1993. Methods A comparison of the evidence in 1993 with the evidence and interpretation of the same health outcomes in 2013. Results Research in the past 20 years has shown that driving while cannabis-impaired approximately doubles car crash risk and that around one in 10 regular cannabis users develop dependence. Regular cannabis use in adolescence approximately doubles the risks of early school-leaving and of cognitive impairment and psychoses in adulthood. Regular cannabis use in adolescence is also associated strongly with the use of other illicit drugs. These associations persist after controlling for plausible confounding variables in longitudinal studies. This suggests that cannabis use is a contributory cause of these outcomes but some researchers still argue that these relationships are explained by shared causes or risk factors. Cannabis smoking probably increases cardiovascular disease risk in middle-aged adults but its effects on respiratory function and respiratory cancer remain unclear, because most cannabis smokers have smoked or still smoke tobacco. Conclusions The epidemiological literature in the past 20 years shows that cannabis use increases the risk of accidents and can produce dependence, and that there are consistent associations between regular cannabis use and poor psychosocial outcomes and mental health in adulthood.},

abstract = {A major challenge in assessing the public health impact of legalizing cannabis use in Colorado and Washington State is the absence of any experience with legal cannabis markets. The Netherlands created a de facto legalized cannabis market for recreational use, but policy analysts disagree about how it has affected rates of cannabis use. Some US states have created de facto legal supply of cannabis for medical use. So far this policy does not appear to have increased cannabis use or cannabis-related harm. Given experience with more liberal alcohol policies, the legalization of recreational cannabis use is likely to increase use among current users. It is also likely that legalization will increase the number of new users among young adults but it remains uncertain how many may be recruited, within what time frame, among which groups within the population, and how many of these new users will become regular users.},

abstract = {The median United States voter supports the legalization of marijuana, at least in part due to a desire to increase state tax revenues. However, states with legal markets have implemented wildly different regulatory schemes with tax rates ranging from 3.75 to 37 percent, indicating that policy makers have a range of beliefs about industry responses to taxes and regulation. We examine a policy reform in Washington: a switch from a 25 percent gross receipts tax collected at every step in the supply chain to a sole 37 percent excise tax at retail. Using novel, comprehensive administrative data, we assess responses to the reform throughout the supply and consumption chain. We find the previous tax regime provided strong incentives for vertical integration. Tax invariance did not hold, with some types of firms benefiting much more than predicted. Consumers bear 44 percent of the additional retail tax burden. Finally, we find evidence that consumer demand for marijuana is price-inelastic in the short-run, but becomes price-elastic within a few weeks of a price increase.},

We evaluated the effects of MMLs on adolescent marijuana use from 2003 through 2011.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We used data from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey and a difference-in-differences design to evaluate the effects of passage of state MMLs on adolescent marijuana use. The states examined (Montana, Rhode Island, Michigan, and Delaware) had passed MMLs at different times over a period of 8 years, ensuring that contemporaneous history was not a design confound.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In 40 planned comparisons of adolescents exposed and not exposed to MMLs across states and over time, only 2 significant effects were found, an outcome expected according to chance alone. Further examination of the (nonsignificant) estimates revealed no discernible pattern suggesting an effect on either self-reported prevalence or frequency of marijuana use.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that, in the states assessed here, MMLs have not measurably affected adolescent marijuana use in the first few years after their enactment. Longer-term results, after MMLs are more fully implemented, might be different.},

abstract = {This paper sheds light on previous inconsistencies identified in the literature regarding the relationship between medical marijuana laws (MMLs) and recreational marijuana use by closely examining the importance of policy dimensions (registration requirements, home cultivation, dispensaries) and the timing of when particular policy dimensions are enacted. Using data from our own legal analysis of state MMLs, we evaluate which features are associated with adult and youth recreational and heavy use by linking these policy variables to data from the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS) and National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY97). We employ differences-in-differences techniques, controlling for state and year fixed effects, allowing us to exploit within-state policy changes. We find that while simple dichotomous indicators of MML laws are not positively associated with marijuana use or abuse, such measures hide the positive influence legal dispensaries have on adult and youth use, particularly heavy use. Sensitivity analyses that help address issues of policy endogeneity and actual implementation of dispensaries support our main conclusion that not all MML laws are the same. Dimensions of these policies, in particular legal protection of dispensaries, can lead to greater recreational marijuana use and abuse among adults and those under the legal age of 21 relative to MMLs without this supply source.

The key feature of a medical marijuana law that facilitates a reduction in overdose death rates is a relatively liberal allowance for dispensaries.

abstract = {To conduct a systematic reviewandmeta-analysis of studies in order to estimate the effect of USmedicalmarijuana laws (MMLs) on past-month marijuana use prevalence among adolescents. Methods A total of 2999 papers from 17 literature sources were screened systematically. Eleven studies, developed from four ongoing large national surveys, were meta-analyzed. Estimates ofMML effects on any past-monthmarijuana use prevalence fromincluded studieswere obtained from comparisons of pre–post MML changes in MML states to changes in non-MML states over comparable time-periods. These estimates were standardized and entered into ameta-analysis model with fixed-effects for each study. Heterogeneity among the study estimates by national data survey was tested with an omnibus F-test. Estimates of effects on additional marijuana outcomes, of MML provisions (e.g. dispensaries) and among demographic subgroups were abstracted and summarized. Key methodological andmodeling characteristics were also described. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Results None of the 11 studies found significant estimates of pre–postMML changes compared with contemporaneous changes in non-MML states for marijuana use prevalence among adolescents. The meta-analysis yielded a non-significant pooled estimate (standardized mean difference) of 0.003 (95{\%} confidence interval = 0.012, +0.007). Four studies compared MML with non-MML states on pre-MML differences and all found higher rates of past-month marijuana use in MML states pre-MML passage. Additional tests of specific MML provisions, of MML effects on additional marijuana outcomes and among subgroups generally yielded nonsignificant results, although limited heterogeneity may warrant further study. Conclusions Synthesis of the current evidence does not support the hypothesis that US medical marijuana laws (MMLs) until 2014 have led to increases in adolescent marijuana use prevalence. Limited heterogeneity exists among estimates of effects of MMLs on other patterns of marijuana use, of effects within particular population subgroups and of effects of specific MML provisions.},

abstract = {Background: National trends in adolescent's marijuana risk perceptions are traditionally used as a predictor of concurrent and future trends in adolescent marijuana use. We test the validity of this practice during a time of rapid marijuana policy change. Methods: Two repeated cross-sectional U.S. nationally-representative surveys of 8th, 10th, and 12th-graders: Monitoring the Future (MTF) (1991–2015; N = 1,181,692) and National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) (2002–2014; N = 113,317). We examined trends in the year-to-year prevalence of perceiving no risk of harm in using marijuana regularly, and prevalence of regular marijuana use within the previous month. A piecewise linear regression model tested for a change in the relationship between trends. Similar analyses examined any past-month use and controlled for demographic characteristics. Results: Among MTF 12th-graders, the prevalence of regular marijuana use and risk perceptions changed similarly between 1991 and 2006 but diverged sharply afterward. The prevalence of regular marijuana use increased by ∼1 percentage point to 6.03{\%} by 2015. In contrast, the proportion of 12th-graders that perceived marijuana as posing no risk increased over 11 percentage points to 21.39{\%}. A similar divergence was found among NSDUH 12th-graders and other grades, for any past month marijuana use, and when controlling demographic characteristics. Conclusions: An increase in adolescent marijuana use has not accompanied recent rapid decreases in marijuana risk perceptions. Policy makers may consider broader prevention strategies in addition to targeting marijuana risk perceptions. Further monitoring of predictors of marijuana use trends is needed as states legalize recreational marijuana use.},

abstract = {I n light of the rapidly shifting landscape regarding the legaliza- tion of marijuana for medical and recreational purposes, patients may be more likely to ask physicians about its potential adverse and beneficial effects on health. The popular notion seems to be that marijuana is a harmless pleasure, ac- cess to which should not be regulated or considered illegal. Currently, marijuana is the most commonly used “illicit” drug in the United States, with about 12{\%} of people 12 years of age or older reporting use in the past year and particularly high rates of use among young people.1 The most common route of administration is inhalation. The greenish-gray shredded leaves and flowers of the Cannabis sativa plant are smoked (along with stems and seeds) in cigarettes, cigars, pipes, water pipes, or “blunts” (marijuana rolled in the tobacco-leaf wrapper from a cigar). Hashish is a related product created from the resin of marijuana flowers and is usually smoked (by itself or in a mixture with tobacco) but can be ingested orally. Marijuana can also be used to brew tea, and its oil-based extract can be mixed into food products. The regular use of marijuana during adolescence is of particular concern, since use by this age group is associated with an increased likelihood of deleterious consequences2 (Table 1). Although multiple studies have reported detrimental ef- fects, others have not, and the question of whether marijuana is harmful remains the subject of heated debate. Here we review the current state of the science re- lated to the adverse health effects of the recreational use of marijuana, focusing on those areas for which the evidence is strongest.},

We also find an increase in marijuana use initiation among those aged 12–20. For those aged 21 or above, MMLs further increase the frequency of binge drinking.

abstract = {21 states and the District of Columbia currently have laws that permit marijuana use for medical purposes, often termed medical marijuana laws (MMLs). We tested the effects of MMLs adopted in seven states between 2004 and 2011 on adolescent and adult marijuana, alcohol, and hard drug use. We employed a restricted-access version of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) micro-level data with geographic identifiers. For those 21 and older, we found that MMLs led to a relative increase in the probability of marijuana use of 16 percent, an increase in marijuana use frequency of 12-17 percent, and an increase in the probability of marijuana abuse/dependence of 15-27 percent. For those 12-20 years old, we found a relative increase in marijuana use initiation of 5-6 percent. Among those aged 21 or above, MMLs increased the frequency of binge drinking by 6-9 percent, but MMLs did not affect drinking behavior among those 12-20 years old. MMLs had no discernible impact on hard drug use in either age group. Taken together, MML implementation increases marijuana use mainly among those over 21, where there is also a spillover effect of increased binge drinking, but there is no evidence of spillovers to other substance use.},
